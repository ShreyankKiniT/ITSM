# ITSM
Machine learning perspective to improve ITSM processes through prediction and automation.

1. Predicting High Priority Tickets: To predict priority 1 & 2 tickets, so that they can take preventive measures or fix the problem before it surfaces.
2. Forecast the incident volume in different fields, quarterly and annual. So that they can be better prepared with resources and technology planning.
3. Auto tag the tickets with the right priorities and right departments so that reassigning and related delay can be reduced.
